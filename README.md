# Two Address Instructions (16bit) CPU

## Computer Organization: Principles, Analysis, and Design

Analysis, design and implementation of the processor, memory and bus arbiter. Operating unit of the processor is realized with two highways. Processor control units are implemented in the following techniques:
1. wired realization without and with step joining, 
2. microprogram implementation and horizontal organization, with two types and one type of microinstruction, 
3. microprogram implementation and vertical organization, with two types and one type of microinstruction,
4. microprogram implementation and mixed organization, with two types and one type of microinstruction

## Structure

Repository is organized as following:
- `doc` directory contains assignment as well as solution document(s)
- `source` directory contains code
